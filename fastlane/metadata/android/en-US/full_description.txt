Are you tired of fighting the snooze button every morning? Do you hit 'dismiss' in a sleepy haze only to wake up late and frantic? It's time to change your relationship with your morning alarm and wake up for real!

Welcome to Lux Alarm, the revolutionary alarm clock designed to get you out of bed by using the one thing you can't ignore: light!

Our app has one simple, powerful rule: the alarm will not stop until your room is filled with light.

‚òÄÔ∏è HOW IT WORKS

To silence the alarm, you have to get up, open the blinds to greet the day, or simply flip on your bedroom light switch. Lux Alarm uses your phone's light sensor to measure the brightness in the room, ensuring you can't cheat your way back to sleep. By the time the alarm is off, you're already on your feet and ready to conquer your day‚Äîno more accidental oversleeping!

This isn't just an alarm; it's a new morning routine. Waking up with light helps to regulate your natural sleep cycle (your circadian rhythm), making you feel more energetic, less groggy, and ready for whatever comes your way.
