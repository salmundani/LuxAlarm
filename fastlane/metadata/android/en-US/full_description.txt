<b>Stop Oversleeping with Lux Alarm</b>

Tired of hitting snooze and waking up late? Lux Alarm ensures you actually get out of bed by requiring light to silence the alarm.

<b>How it works</b>

To stop the alarm, you must get up and open your blinds or turn on the light. The app uses your phone's sensor to detect brightness; by the time the alarm turns off, you are already on your feet and ready to start your day.

<b>Key Features</b>

• Smart Light Detection: Uses your phone's sensor to ensure the alarm only deactivates once your environment is bright.
• Adjustable Sensitivity: Customize the required light level to account for gloomy weather or different room setups.
• Modern Interface: A clean, intuitive design based on Material Design 3 for easy navigation.
• Circadian Support: Waking up with light helps regulate your natural sleep cycle and reduces morning grogginess.
