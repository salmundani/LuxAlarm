**Lux Alarm** is a light-sensitive alarm clock designed to ensure you get out of bed. The alarm remains active until it detects a specific level of ambient light in your room.

## How It Works

To disable the alarm, you must increase the room's brightness, either by opening your blinds or turning on a light. The app utilizes your phone's built-in **ambient light sensor** to measure the brightness level, preventing you from simply hitting "snooze" while remaining in the dark.

## Key Features

* **Light-Based Deactivation:** The alarm only stops once a pre-defined light threshold is met.
* **Adjustable Sensitivity:** Customize the required brightness level to account for different environments or weather conditions.
* **Modern Interface:** A clean, minimal UI built using **Material Design 3**.
